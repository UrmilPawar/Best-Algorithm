# Best Classification Algorithm 
- This was one of my projects as a part of Rinex AI training and Internship done in my 1st year of Engineering
- This Project tests various ML algorithms for the Australian rain dataset and displays their accuracy score which can help us to find best possible algorithm.
- Multiple classification models used -Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict "will it rain tommorow ?" and comparing their accuracies
- The dataset used was https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package
